Stripe Webhook
==============================

The `StripeWebhook` class is a powerful tool for processing Stripe webhooks in your Django application. It provides a simple and flexible way to handle incoming webhook requests, allowing you to focus on implementing your business logic.

## Using the `StripeWebhook`
--------------------------------

To use the `StripeWebhook` class, you'll need to create a new class that inherits from it. This new class will define the logic for processing incoming webhook requests.

Here's an example of how you might use the `StripeWebhook` class to implement a new webhook:

!!! Example "Example Webhook"
    ```python
    from django_stripe.actions import StripeWebhook

    class MyWebhook(StripeWebhook):
        def process_webhook(self, event_data):
            # Process the incoming webhook request here
            # For example, you might update a database record or send a notification
            print("Received webhook event:", event_data)
    ```
In this example, the `MyWebhook` class inherits from `StripeWebhook` and defines a `process_webhook` method. This method will be called whenever an incoming webhook request is received.

### Automatic Registration

One of the benefits of using the `StripeWebhook` class is that you don't need to register the webhook manually. The class will automatically register the webhook with Stripe when it's instantiated.

This means that you can focus on implementing your business logic, without worrying about the underlying registration process.

### Example Use Case

Here's an example of how you might use the `StripeWebhook` class to implement a webhook that updates a database record when a customer's subscription is updated:

!!! Example "Example Use Case"
    ```python
    from django_stripe.actions import StripeWebhook
    from django_stripe.models import StripeCustomer

    class SubscriptionUpdatedWebhook(StripeWebhook):
        def process_webhook(self, event_data):
            customer_id = event_data["data"]["object"]["customer"]
            customer = StripeCustomer.objects.get(stripe_id=customer_id)
            customer.subscription_status = event_data["data"]["object"]["status"]
            customer.save()
    ```
In this example, the `SubscriptionUpdatedWebhook` class inherits from `StripeWebhook` and defines a `process_webhook` method. This method updates a `Customer` record in the database when a subscription is updated.

### Tips and Best Practices

* Make sure to handle any exceptions that might occur during the processing of incoming webhook requests.
* Use the `process_webhook` method to perform any necessary business logic, such as updating database records or sending notifications.
* Use the `event_data` parameter to access the incoming webhook request data.
* Use the `stripe` library to interact with the Stripe API, if necessary.

By following these tips and best practices, you can use the `StripeWebhook` class to implement powerful and flexible webhooks in your Django application.

## Implementing Webhook API
-------------------------------

To implement a webhook API, you need to create a view that handles incoming webhook requests and processes the event data using the `StripeWebhook` class.

Here is an example of how to implement a webhook API using Django:

!!! Example "Implement Webhook API using Django"
    ```python
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    from django.views.decorators.http import require_http_methods
    from django_stripe.actions import StripeWebhook

    @require_http_methods(["POST"])
    def stripe_webhook(request):
        event_data = request.json()
        StripeWebhook.process_webhook(event_data)
        return HttpResponse("Webhook processed successfully")
    ```
This example creates a view that handles incoming webhook requests, processes the event data using the `StripeWebhook` class, and returns a success response.

You can also use a library like Django Rest Framework to implement a webhook API. Here is an example:
!!! Example "Implement Webhook API using DRF"
    ```python
    from rest_framework.views import APIView
    from rest_framework.response import Response
    from django_stripe.actions import StripeWebhook

    class StripeWebhookView(APIView):
        def post(self, request):
            event_data = request.data
            StripeWebhook.process_webhook(event_data)
            return Response("Webhook processed successfully")
    ```
This example creates a view that handles incoming webhook requests, processes the event data using the `StripeWebhook` class, and returns a success response.

## Registering Webhook API
-----------------------------

To register the webhook API, you need to add a URL pattern to your Django project's URL configuration. Here is an example:
!!! Example
    ```python
    from django.urls import path
    from .views import stripe_webhook

    urlpatterns = [
        path("stripe/webhook/", stripe_webhook, name="stripe_webhook"),
    ]
    ```
This example adds a URL pattern for the `stripe_webhook` view.

You can also use a library like Django Rest Framework to register the webhook API. Here is an example:
!!! Example
    ```python
    from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
    from .views import StripeWebhookView

    router = DefaultRouter()
    router.register("stripe/webhook", StripeWebhookView, basename="stripe_webhook")

    urlpatterns = router.urls
    ```
This example registers the `StripeWebhookView` view using the `DefaultRouter` class.
